### Max object patcher ###
1. Extract Geometry Dash apk with WinRAR, 7-zip or your APK tool
2. Put mop executable in the game files and run it
3. Choose the game version by typing 1.0, 1.01, 1.02, etc.

### Notice ###
The project is being discontinued as I'm working on a GUI version called mop_2.
However, the console version will still receive bugfixes.
Thanks for using mop :P
